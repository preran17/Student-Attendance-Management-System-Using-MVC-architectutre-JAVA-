# Student-Attendance-Management-System-Using-MVC-architectutre-JAVA-
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
The problem statement is to design and develop a Student Attendance Management System using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in Java. The goal of the system is to manage student attendance records for a school or university.

The Student Attendance Management System will have the following features:
A database to store student information and attendance records.
A login system for teachers and administrators.
A dashboard for teachers to view and manage attendance records.
A report generation system for administrators to view attendance statistics.
ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN: 

The architectural pattern that will be used for the Student Attendance Management System in Java is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 
The MVC pattern is a popular architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the view is responsible for the presentation of the data to the user, and the controller manages the interaction between the model and the view.
In the case of the Student Attendance Management System, the model will contain the database that stores the student information and attendance records. The model will handle the retrieval and storage of the data and will be responsible for any business logic required, such as calculating attendance percentages.
The view will display the attendance records to the user. Teachers will be able to view and manage attendance records through a dashboard. The view will also display reports generated by the system to administrators.
The controller will handle the user interaction with the application. It will receive input from the user, such as attendance data, and pass it on to the model to be stored. It will also receive requests for data from the view and retrieve it from the model.
Using the MVC pattern for the Student Attendance Management System in Java will result in a modular and maintainable design. The separation of concerns between the model, view, and controller will make it easier to modify and update the application without affecting the other components. Additionally, the clear separation of responsibilities will make it easier to test each component individually, which can improve the overall quality of the application.

DESIGN PATTERNS: 

1. Singleton Pattern:
The AttendanceController class is implemented using the Singleton pattern, which ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the JVM. The constructor of the class is made private, and a public static getInstance() method is provided to access the instance of the class.

2. MVC Pattern:
The code sample implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The AttendanceController class serves as the Model, the AttendanceView class serves as the View, and the interaction between the two classes is managed by the Controller. 

3. Factory Method Pattern:
The code sample does not use the Factory Method pattern explicitly, but it can be inferred that the AttendanceController class has a factory method to create instances of Course, Student, and Faculty classes. 

4. Strategy Pattern:
The code sample does not use the Strategy pattern explicitly, but it can be inferred that the AttendanceController class uses different strategies to perform different operations like adding/removing faculty, students, courses, updating attendance, etc. 

5. Iterator Pattern:
The code sample uses the Iterator pattern implicitly when iterating over the List of courses and attendance in the AttendanceView class. 

6. Null Object Pattern:
The code sample does not use the Null Object pattern explicitly, but it can be inferred that the faculty object is given a null value in the Course constructor if the facultyId is not provided.
